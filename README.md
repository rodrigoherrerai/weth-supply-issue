# Weth Supply

This proof of concept was inspired by [this twitter thread] (https://twitter.com/gf_256/status/1593060248805310465)

The main discovery is that the Weth9 contract "totalSupply()" getter can be inaccurate.

- totalSupply() returns the Eth balance not the Weth balance:

```sol
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint) {
        return this.balance;
    }
```

- When transfering Eth through selfDestruct, the fallback function won't be triggered, therefore bypassing minting of Weth. This will make the Weth contract having more Eth than Weth, therefore the "totalSupply" function won't be accurate.

##Â Usage

Install:

```
npm i
```

Test:

```
npm run test
```

## Note

This is not a problem because there will always be more Eth than Weth minted.
